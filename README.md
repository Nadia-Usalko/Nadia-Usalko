Hi, I am Nadia, and I am a Junior Data Analyst.  
I started learning data analytics to gain more skills for my previous job - Customer Service Manager. It was essential to explore customer satisfaction surveys, hotel incident reports, employee information and I wanted to be able to delve into the data and thoroughly investigate it.   
I started my data journey in 2023 with exploring spreadsheets, followed by SQL, Tableau and R. Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate was a powerful boost to my development.  
I enjoy brainstorming creative solutions and go deep into detail to understand the areas of opportunity. :sunglasses:
